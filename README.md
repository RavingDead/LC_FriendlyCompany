A mod aimed at making some enemies friendlier!

![FriendlyBees_Demo](https://github.com/RavingDead/LC_FriendlyCompany/assets/154840527/21e57bee-f068-490f-a397-c200aa59c856)

This mod makes some of the monsters more forgiving without completely removing their mechanics.

## Supported Friendly Monsters
### Bees
- Bees will be innoffensive at first, but if you take the beehive they'll get angry!
- Bees have a very keen sense of memory: they don't forgive and they don't forget.
