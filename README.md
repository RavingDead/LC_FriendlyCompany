A mod aimed at making some enemies friendlier!

![](./docs/gifs/FriendlyBees_Demo.gif)

This mod makes some of the monsters more forgiving without completely removing their mechanics.

## Supported Friendly Monsters
### Bees
- Bees will be innoffensive at first, but if you take the beehive they'll get angry!
- Bees have a very keen sense of memory: they don't forgive and they don't forget.
